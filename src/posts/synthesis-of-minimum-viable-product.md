Minimum Viable Product was introduced by [The Lean Startup](http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898). In addition, you will find numerous  posts in the internet describing it. And people will talk about it and will try to define using examples or detailing what they think it is. 

At the end of the day we all fall in the trap of decorating a concept, using the same three words found in its name. Instead of using words lets put it all together with three images:

**the minimum: enough to work and work well**

**viable: capable of living, under normal conditions**

**product: should be functional, reliable, usable and emotionally connect**

Anything else, is just a prototype: you learn from it and throw away, or you put it in a trouphy case.
